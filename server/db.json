He is also selfless and will do what he believes is right, even if he doesn't think it through first. Throughout the pilgrimage, he matures and becomes more level-headed and grounded. Tidus is upbeat and carefree and at first appears childish. He turns more serious when things get hectic, and despite his carefree ways, conceals a troubled past. Tidus is sensitive and even when giving an emotional response to most of his arguments, tends to give a good rationale. Despite having been picked on throughout his childhood by his blitzball-playing father, Tidus was motivated to become a top blitzball player himself.",

She is naive, always believing in the best of people, and places the needs of others above her own, becoming apologetic when she feels she has let someone down. Like most summoners, Yuna is a devout follower of Yevon's teachings. She hides her feelings of fear and sadness while encouraging her friends to express themselves in her place. She is willing to carry others' burdens and sacrifice everything she has to destroy Sin, giving up chances for her own happiness if it means helping others. Her interactions with Tidus make her question Yevon's teachings, and she becomes more direct and open. When her faith in Yevon is shaken, Yuna must find her own path in life and pursue her goals without the backing of faith.",

She is nonetheless kind-hearted, caring and intelligent, and is one of the few Yevonites to question the religion on objective terms. Having lost her lover to Sin, Lulu has become reserved and prefers to keep her emotions locked up, choosing to examine the world with realism and logic.

She also serves as the voice of reason grounding them to think things through and do the right thing. Tifa is empathic, motherly, intuitive, and reserved, both out of being observant and for being emotionally shy. Tifa identifies the feelings of others, offering sanctuary and protection for her teammates. While looking out for others, she rarely discusses her own feelings: when asked, she will either express surprise, or quickly change the subject. Tifa considers all options and takes in all information before acting, (best seen when she does not speak up about Cloud's confused past until she is certain of her own recollection of events), and encourages others to practice this same restraint and think things through first. Tifa can and does fight to defend herself, often preferring to so as not to get others involved. While normally reserved, Tifa still shows aggression at times, but has low self-confidence and is overly self-critical of her faults, always pushing herself to do better.",
